## Welcome to open source by Syngenta!

At [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.com/en/company/our-purpose-and-contribution), our ambition is to bring plant potential to life. We believe in the power of collaboration to help farmers sustainably feed the world. 
Our Open Source Program wants to support and be part of the community by creating a dialogue through our projects to build better solutions together.  

You can get in touch with us here: ospo@syngenta.com

We also invite you to look at our collaboration platform, [Shoots by Syngenta™](https://shootsbysyngenta.com/innovation), where we're bringing together individuals and organizations to tackle some of the world’s most complex agricultural challenges: for nature, farmers and food security.
